As a fitness trainer, I'm working with a client who has provided answers to several questions related to their fitness and dietary goals. Based on their answers, I would like you to help organize their 'Foods' and 'Trains' into specific recommendations for each day of the week.

### Important:
1. I am sending you three arrays:
    - 'Foods': A list of possible food options with their corresponding IDs.
    - 'Trains': A list of possible workouts and exercises with their corresponding IDs.
    - 'userDetails': The client's detailed information based on their answers to the quiz.
    
2. Based on the 'userDetails', select appropriate items from the 'Foods' and 'Trains' arrays for each day of the week.

3. For the 'Foods' array:
    - Each day of the week (Saturday to Friday) should contain **three** entries for food (one for Breakfast, one for Lunch, one for Dinner).
    - You will need to return the food recommendations in JSON format, with each food being selected by its ID from the 'Foods' array.
    - Along with the food ID, you need to specify the meal time: either 'Breakfast', 'Lunch', or 'Dinner'.

4. For the 'Trains' array:
    - Each day of the week (Saturday to Friday) should contain 2 or 3 separate workout recommendations for each ID_Trainer.
    - Each recommendation should be listed as a separate JSON object with fields: ID_Trainer, ID_Train, Day_Of_Week, and Steps.
    - The Steps field should be an integer representing the number of steps, repetitions, or sets for the workout.
  
### Output Format:
The result should be returned in the following JSON format:

{
    "Foods": {
        "Saturday": [
            {"ID": ..., "Time": "Breakfast"},
            {"ID": ..., "Time": "Lunch"},

            {"ID_Trainer": ..., "ID_Train": ..., "Day_Of_Week": "Wednesday", "Steps": ...}
        ],

            {"ID_Trainer": ..., "ID_Train": ..., "Day_Of_Week": "Friday", "Steps": ...}
        ]
    }
}
